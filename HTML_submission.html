                     Introduction to World Wide Web
                   </h3>
                   <p>
                     The World Wide web is a collection of <b><em>HTML</em></b> documents. HTML stands for <em> HyperText Markup Language</em>.
                   It is composed of <em>text</em> content (i.e. what you see) and <em>markup</em> (i.e. what it looks like). It can also consist of references to other
                   documents and links to other pages. HTML is the basis of all the web.
                   Regardless of what kind of document we see on the web such as images, videos, text etc.
                   HTML brings them altogether to give us the world wide web. The internet was invented in the 1990s and has over 30 billion pages.

                   </h3>
                   <p>
                     The web has 5 main components that interact with each other to give us the world wide web.
                   These are <em><b>client</b>, <b>browser</b>, <b>internet</b>, <b>HTTP</b> and <b>servers</b> </em>. You are the <em>client</em>, who uses a web <em>browser</em> on a computer to
                   access the <em>internet</em>, which is just like a cloud. The internet then sends a <b>HTTP</b> request to a
                   <em>server</em>, which is a computer specialized to store large amounts of data. The server then sends the appropriate document back
                   which you can view on your browser. This <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/483298540923#"> video </a> explains this in further detail and the picture below illustrates the idea:

                   <p>
                     HTML <b>elements</b> make up HTML documents. These <em> elements</em> are composed of HTML <b> tags</b> and content. Tags are used to tell browsers the type of each element.

                   </h3>
                   <p> Computers cannot decipher ambiguity and hence interpret instructions literally. This can cause a small error in code to
              result in a much larger problem in a program. Therefore code should be written in a very unambigous and easy to understand manner.

                   </h3>
                   <p> HTML elements are of two types: <b> inline</b> and <b> block</b>. <em> Block </em> elements make an "invisible box" around the content inside them.
              This is further explained in this <a href="https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd000/parts/0001345401/modules/385165862675460/lessons/3873828673/concepts/487234380923#"> video </a>.

                   "Tree-like Structure" of HTML
                 </h3>
                   <p>HTML has a tree like structure and this is because HTML elements can have other elements inside of them. Every time an element has another element in it, it forms another branch on the tree.
              This tree can have from a few to numerous branches depending on the complexity of the code. This structure shows up as boxes in a browser. So you usually see boxes inside of boxes and so on. The more indented an element is, the more deeply nested its corresponding box is.

                     HTML vs. CSS vs. DOM
                   </h3>
                   <p>HTML and CSS are both languages but they control different aspects of a document/webpage. HTML controls the <em> structure </em> and <em> content</em>  whereas CSS controls the <em> style </em> of the page (how it looks). Both of these languages have their
              own syntax and rules. DOM which stands for <b> Document Object Model</b> shows the tree-like structure of a webpage. It turns tags in HTML to elements in a tree and is the standard convention for representing and interacting with elements in HTML.
              In various browsers, it is possible to select a function called "developer tools" which shows the HTML, CSS and DOM of any website, which can then further be used to edit or play around with components of the website. Furthermore, programmers can also use special text editors
              (like sublime text) to make their lives easier. These text editors color-code tags to make them easier to see and also assist in writing code by generating a closing tag when you write an opening tag, among other things.

                   </h3>
                   <p> Everything on a webpage is divided into boxes, regardless of its shape. The entire webpage is divided into grids where these boxes fit and it is possible to move boxes around within these grids.

                 <h3>
                   CSS
                 </h3>
                 <p> CSS stands for <b><em> Cascading Style Sheets </em> </b> and as mentioned above, it controls the style of an HTML document and how it looks. This is done by giving the same <b>class</b> name to similar html elements and then specifying what sytle will be applied to each class.
                   There are three ways of writing CSS: <br>
                   1. In the "head" section of your HTML <br>
                   2. Linking your HTML to a separate CSS file <br>
                   3. Inline with HTML <br>
                   <br>
                   Among these, 2. is the most commonly used and helps one stay organized for larger projects, 1. is good but only for smaller projects and 3. is usually a bad idea because it involves a lot of repitition, something that programmers hate.
                   CSS also helps programmers avoid repitition, which is a huge component of programming.
                 </p>

               <div class="Concept-title" id="Lesson-3-2">
                 <h3> Avoiding Repitition </h3>
                 <p> If programmers don't avoid repitition, they may have to write style attributes for all HTML elements separately or copy-paste a lot of the same style or even rewrite it for each element with minor differences. Obviously this will make the process a lot more exhausting, will
                    make any editing very stressful and also increase the possibility of errors. Whereas on the contrary, avoiding repitition makes both writing and editing code more convenient and a lot more enjoyable. CSS can be very efficiently used to avoid repitition as explained in the paragraph above.
